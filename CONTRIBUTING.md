# Contributing to Landscape (Open Funders Canada)

Welcome and thanks for joining me!  

I'm new to github and working open, so please bear with me.

I'm open to any suggestions on materials and information that you need to help contribute more effectively.  You can do so [here](https://github.com/lesliePhD/open_funders_canada/issues/5).  

## What is Landscape (Open Funders Canada)

Landscape (http://landscape.ajah.ca/) is a pilot project for an open tool that helps people find out who is funding who, for what kind of projects, and when this funding is happening.  This includes funding from governments, foundations, and corporations.  

I work for a nonprofit called __Powered by Data__ (http://poweredbydata.org) and we are particularly interested in open funding data for the social sector.  Landscape is meant to be a user-friendly tool for low capacity users to easily search what kind of funding is happening in their spaces of interest (geographical, issue related, ect).  The tool intends to make the work of nonprofits and their funders more efficient.  Landscape will __help identify overlap and points of collaboration, gaps in services, as well as previously undiscovered funders or fundees__.  Academics may also be interested in this tool for the purposes of research.  Because Landscape also publishes open data, it then creates the conditions to enable social innovation in the grantmaking sector.    

## Contributing Guidelines
Here you can find the code of conduct for contributing to Landscape (Open Funders Canada): [Mozilla Contributers' Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/).  These are guielines, not rules.  They should make it easy for anyone to participate in the project.  

## What kind of Contributions?
I am looking to gain valuable feedback from users in order to improve our pilot. I am also seeking additional contributors to help populate Landscape by data scraping grantmaking data from funders sites (governmental, foundations, or corporate).

If you are a __nonprofit, funder, or academic__, I would like your UX feedback. Including, but not limited to:

What kind of grantmaking information are you looking for? (ie. what are you trying to find out?)
What other funders would you like to see?
What fields do you (or would you) find useful to be able to search by?

If you are a __techie__ and know how to scrape data from websites, I need to learn how to do this. Extra bonus points if you are able to teach me to do it myself.  I have [posted some guidance](https://github.com/lesliePhD/open_funders_canada/issues/4) on what kind of websites to scrape and what fields to scrape.  If you have more questions, you can contact me there.  

I would also take some assistance from __UX research and UX design__ folks who want to help me improve how people use the tool.

And possibly some __design__ folks who want to make the tool pretty.

## Global Sprint 2017!
We are participating in the [Global Sprint in June](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/)! Come join us from 9-5 EST.  Looking to see if a physical Montreal team will be formed.  

## Contact
