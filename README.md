# Welcome to Open Funders Canada (Landscape)

This is the Github repo for Landscape.  Landscape (http://landscape.ajah.ca/) is a pilot project for an open tool that helps people find out who is funding who, for what kind of projects, and when this funding is happening.  This includes funding from governments, foundations, and corporations.  

I work for a nonprofit called __Powered by Data__ (http://poweredbydata.org) and we are particularly interested in open funding data for the social sector.  Landscape is meant to be a user-friendly tool for low capacity users to easily search what kind of funding is happening in their spaces of interest (geographical, issue related, ect).  The tool intends to make the work of nonprofits and their funders more efficient.  Landscape will __help identify overlap and points of collaboration, gaps in services, as well as previously undiscovered funders or fundees__.  Academics may also be interested in this tool for the purposes of research.  Because Landscape also publishes open data, it then creates the conditions to enable social innovation in the grantmaking sector.    

## How to get involved
 
I am looking to gain valuable feedback from users in order to improve our pilot.  I am also seeking additional contributors to help populate Landscape by data scraping grantmaking data from funders sites (governmental, foundations, or corporate). 

If you are a __nonprofit, funder, or academic__, I would like your UX feedback.  Including, but not limited to: 
* What kind of grantmaking information are you looking for? (ie. what are you trying to find out?)
* What other funders would you like to see?
* What fields do you (or would you) find useful to be able to search by?

If you are a __techie__ and know how to scrape data from websites, I need to learn how to do this.  Extra bonus points if you are able to teach me to do it myself. 

I would also take some assistance from __UX research and UX design__ folks who want to help me improve how people use the tool.  

And possibly some __design folks__ who want to make the tool pretty.
