# Welcome to Open Funders Canada (Landscape)

This is the Github repo for Landscape.  Landscape (http://landscape.ajah.ca/) is a pilot project for an open tool that helps people find out who is funding who, for what kind of projects, and when this funding is happening.  This includes funding from governments, foundations, and corporations.  

I work for a nonprofit called __Powered by Data__ (http://poweredbydata.org) and we are particularly interested in open funding data for the social sector.  Landscape is meant to be a user-friendly tool for low capacity users to easily search what kind of funding is happening in their spaces of interest (geographical, issue related, ect).  The tool intends to make the work of nonprofits and their funders more efficient.  Landscape will __help identify overlap and points of collaboration, gaps in services, as well as previously undiscovered funders or fundees__.  Academics may also be interested in this tool for the purposes of research.  Because Landscape also publishes open data, it then creates the conditions to enable social innovation in the grantmaking sector.    

I am currently building up this repo to help move the project along and gain contributers.  Stay tuned!
