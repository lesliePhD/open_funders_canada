# Roadmap for Open Funders Canada
## Project Summary & Welcome
 
Hello World,
 
I work for a nonprofit in Montreal, Quebec, Canada called Powered by Data.  We work to improve the nonprofit sector through the effective use of data, particularly open data. 
 
We have a pilot project called Landscape.  It uses data scraped from online sources, including open data, to create a tool for nonprofits, funders (governments and foundations) and academics that will improve their ability to find comprehensive information on who is funding who and for what kind of work.  It will help users discover opportunities for funding (giving or receiving), collaboration, and new programming ideas.  It will improve the ability for users to make more informed and strategic decisions about the work that they do.  The bonus is that it will create open data on grantmaking across Canada. 
 
Our overarching goal is to increase the social impact of the social sector.  In addition, having open data on grantmaking will create the conditions necessary for social innovation in the social sector. 
 

## How to get involved
 
I am looking to gain valuable feedback from users in order to improve our pilot.  I am also seeking additional contributors to help populate Landscape by data scraping grantmaking data from funders sites (governmental, foundations, or corporate). 

If you are a nonprofit, funder, or academic, I would like your UX feedback.  Including, but not limited to: 
What kind of grantmaking information are you looking for? (ie. what are you trying to find out?)
What other funders would you like to see?
What fields do you (or would you) find useful to be able to search by?

If you are a techie and know how to scrape data from websites, I need to learn how to do this.  Extra bonus points if you are able to teach me to do it myself. 

I would also take some assistance from UX research and UX design folks who want to help me improve how people use the tool.  

And possibly some design folks who want to make the tool pretty.
